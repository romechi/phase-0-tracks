# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
Version control allows an individual or team to keep track of file/code changes during development process.

* What is a branch and why would you use one?
Branching is copying a project code/file folder from a master repo to work on your machine locally.

* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
A commit is a short message about the recent change(s) attached to a file when updated. A good commit allows you to create a snapshot and know what changed in a file without always having to open the file. Multiple commit's help create the projects history.

* What is a merge conflict?
A merge conflict happens when code/file(s) have changed within branch/master with the same name are merged back together and causes a conflict.
